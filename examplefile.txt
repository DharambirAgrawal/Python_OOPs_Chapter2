The output will be a bar chart where:

The x-axis represents the alphabetic characters (a-z).
The y-axis represents the frequency of each character that appeared in the document.
This approach ensures that both file and direct text input methods are supported.

Input: The user inputs a polynomial in terms of 
𝑥
x (e.g., 3*x**2 + 2*x + 1).
Sympy: The sympify function from sympy converts the input string into a symbolic polynomial expression.
Derivative: The diff function calculates the first derivative of the polynomial with respect to 
𝑥
x.
Output: The derivative is then displayed.
